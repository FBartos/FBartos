# Hi there!

I'm Franti≈°ek, a PhD candidate in Psychology at the University of Amsterdam and co-founder of JASP Services. I'm passionate about making statistical methods more accessible and helping researchers draw better conclusions from their data.

## What I work on

- **Research**: Bayesian statistics, meta-analyses, and publication bias adjustment methods
- **Software**: Developing R packages and contributing to [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) statistical software
- **Teaching**: Meta-analysis and Bayesian inference courses
- **Fun fact**: I flipped way to many coins in my life

## Some things I've built

- **[RoBMA](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RoBMA)** - Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis - An R package for highly customizable Bayesian model-averaged meta-analytic models
- **[zcurve](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zcurve)** - Z-Curve - An R package for estimating replication rates from test statistics
- **[Meta-Analysis module for JASP](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspMetaAnalysis)** - Making meta-analysis accessible to everyone via JASP
